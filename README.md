# Storm Reply - Daily Coding Problem

This is a playground for solving programming problems in Kotlin. For now the source for the problems to solve is the website [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com).

> [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com) is an interview preparation service. We collect the most popular coding interview questions and send one hard interview programming problem to your inbox every day. We write up easy-to-understand solutions to them and send them the day after (so you can think about the problem during the day).
